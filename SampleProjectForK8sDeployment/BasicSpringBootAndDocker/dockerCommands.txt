1) docker build -f Dockerfile -t basic-springboot-project .
The above command will create a docker image.The docker image name should always 
be in lower case. This command should be run in the folder where the "Dockerfile" exists.

2)docker run --name basicspringboot-docker-app -p 8085:8085 basic-springboot-project:latest

here --name is used to give the container created a name
--p is for port forwarding from the container to the host machine where the container runs

the port should be the port that the application is configured to run

then give the name of the image:<version of the image> from which you want to create the 
container.

3) now run the url in the browser "http://localhost:8085/rest/docker/hello"
